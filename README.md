# EMR Containers (i.e. EMR on EKS)

Using **AWS EMR on EKS** (also known as *EMR Containers*), this repository provides practical examples and detailed explanations for using this specific service.

Although this service is relatively new and less commonly used than the traditional EMR service, it is a powerful tool for users already leveraging EKS who want to run Spark jobs on their EKS cluster. While there are other examples available online, most lack a comprehensive start-to-finish guide for setting up and using this service, including building infrastructure and configuring policies from scratch.

## Assumptions for Local Machine Setup

Before proceeding with this project, ensure the following prerequisites are met on your local machine:

1. **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with valid credentials (I used this version/setup: `aws-cli/2.4.5 Python/3.8.8 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off`). Have a specific profile name ready if required (other than so-called `default`).
2. **Terraform**: Version `v0.14.7` was used. If issues arise with versioning, use [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) to manage multiple Terraform versions.
3. **PowerShell**: Version `5.1.22621.2506` was used to run scripts.
4. **Docker**: Configuration may vary depending on your OS and use case (solo vs. company). Below is the setup used for this project (Windows 11, solo setup):

5. **eksctl**: Installed via Chocolatey (`choco install eksctl`), version `0.179.0`.

## Disclosures

- Deploying and using the resources in this project will incur AWS costs, especially in production environments. The default setup is configured to minimize costs (~$75/month for the cheapest EKS cluster). 
- To avoid unnecessary charges, destroy the resources when not in use (e.g., using the `terraform destroy` command).

---

## Tutorial: Initial Setup

Follow these steps to set up the necessary resources for EMR on EKS:

1. Clone the repository and switch to the `main` branch.
2. Run `terraform init` from the root directory.
3. Run `terraform apply` and confirm the changes. Ensure you have:
    - Proper AWS profile permissions and CLI configuration.
    - Installed Docker, PowerShell, and eksctl as mentioned in the [Assumptions](#assumptions-for-local-machine-setup).
4. Wait for the resources to be created (10â€“30 minutes, depending on your AWS region and resources).
